      "4. **#1 Core Java (Entry Level):** While valuable, it's less important than Advanced Java if hiring experienced developers. If targeting juniors, this would be higher.\n",
      "5. **#3 Java Web Services:** Important if the role involves web services.\n",
      "6. **#7 Swing:**  Relevant if the role involves desktop application development.\n",
      "7. **#8 Selenium:** Useful if the role involves testing, which can indirectly demonstrate collaboration with QA teams.\n",
      "8. **#10 JavaScript:**  Front-end knowledge is often beneficial for Java developers, particularly in web development, and can improve collaboration with front-end teams.\n",
      "9. **#6 Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition 1.4 Fundamental:** J2EE 1.4 is quite outdated.  While it might be useful for some legacy systems, it's less relevant than more modern Java technologies. While this assessment is adaptive, that's not a requirement.\n",
